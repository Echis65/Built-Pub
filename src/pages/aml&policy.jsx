          </h1>
          <p>
            {" "}
            This Policy and Manual has been formulated by Built to reinforce the broad AML/CFT legal requirements and more importantly, to provide best-practice guidance to Built’s staff on how to implement the relevant legal provisions.
            Money laundering (ML) has been defined as the process whereby criminals attempt to or conceal the illegal origin of illegitimate ownership of property and assets that are the fruits or proceeds of their criminal activities. It is, thus, a derivative crime. Financing of Terrorism (FT) is a reverse form of money laundering and may involve both legitimate and illegitimate money. It is characterized by concealment of the origin or intended criminal use of the funds.
            Money laundering and terrorist financing are global phenomena and there has been growing recognition in recent times, and indeed, well-documented evidence, that both money laundering and terrorist financing pose major threats to international peace and security and could seriously undermine national development and progress.
            Consequently, concerted global efforts have been made to check these crimes. Financial Institutions, in particular, have come under unprecedented regulatory pressure to enhance their monitoring and surveillance systems with a view to preventing, detecting and responding appropriately to money laundering and terrorist financing.
            This Manual covers the following key areas:

            {" "}
            Money laundering involves taking criminal proceeds and disguising their illegal source in anticipation of ultimately using the criminal proceeds to perform legal and illegal activities. Simply put, money laundering is the process of making dirty money look clean.

            Traditionally, it has been accepted that Money Laundering occurs in three separate/fundamental stages

            <ul className={styles.lists}>
              <li>Placement of Cash-how the criminal proposes to introduce the dirty money into the system.</li>
              <li>Layering-utilizing multiple transaction e.g. purchase of commodities, payment of false invoices to partner companies, foreign investment etc., which confuses
                the audit trail and separates the money from its origin.
              </li>
              <li>Integration-inserting the criminal proceeds into legitimate business so as to give the appearance of normal business funds.</li>

          </h1>
          <p>
            {" "}
            Terrorism can be defined as the unlawful use of force against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population or any segment thereof, in the furtherance of political or social objectives. Terrorist acts are criminal in nature and constitute a serious threat to the individuals’ lives and freedom.
            Terrorist funding relates to provision or collection of funds to carry out an act of killing or seriously injuring a civilian with the objective of intimidating a section of the people or compelling a government to do or to abstain from doing any act.

            <span className={styles.label}>1.4</span> Difference Between Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing
          </h1>
          <p>
          The most basic difference between money laundering and terrorist financing involves the origin or source of the funds. Terrorist financing uses funds for an illegal political purpose, but the money is not necessarily derived from illicit proceeds. It could be from a genuine source as well. On the other hand, money laundering always involves the proceeds of illegal activity or a predicate offense committed.

          <p>‘’Know Your Customer’’ (KYC) requirement entails obtaining full particulars of the identity of a customer and having adequate knowledge of the purpose for which the customer desires to establish a business relationship with a financial institution. Having adequate knowledge of a customer and applying it to all transactions initiated by the customer is an effective way of avoiding being used to launder the proceeds of crime and recognizing suspicious activities.Thus, Built Financial Technologies shall establish clear and written procedures for verifying the identity of persons who open new accounts. The procedures should state the types of information the institution will collect from customers and how it will verify each customer’s identity.</p>

          <p>Built Financial Technologies will not establish a business relationship until all relevant counterparties to the relationship have been identified and the nature of the business they intend to conduct has been duly ascertained. Once an on-going business relationship has been established and the normal operation confirmed, any inconsistent activity would be investigated to determine whether there is a suspicion of money laundering.</p>

          </h3>
          <p>The first requirement of knowing your customer for money laundering purposes is that the Built should be satisfied that a prospective customer is who he/she claims to be. Built shall not carry out, or agree to carry out, any financial business or provide advice to a customer or potential customer, unless Built is certain about who that person actually is. If the customer is acting on behalf of another, e.g. the funds are being supplied by someone else, or the investment is to be held in the name of someone else, we have an obligation to verify the identity of both the customer and the agent/trustee unless the customer is itself a regulated financial institution within the country.</p>

          <p>Adequate steps should be taken to keep the information up to date as the opportunities arise, e.g. when an existing customer opens a new account on the Built software. Such information obtained during any contact with the customer should be recorded and kept in the customer’s file to ensure, as far as practicable, that current customer information is readily available to the Compliance Officer or relevant regulatory bodies.</p>

          Built Financial Technologies adopt a risk-based approach in implementing its KYC policy in respect of categorizing customers into a three-tier risk rating. Built Financial Technologies will rely on an objective risk rating template in achieving this results. The factors to be used in the risk rating shall include geographical location of the customer or where the entity business is situate, object of the entity, nationality of the customer, customer type, and the product or service being offered the customer among others. Customers or accounts to be classified as high risk shall be subjected to enhanced due diligence and constant monitoring of its transactions thereof. They shall include but not limited to:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>

          </p>
          <p>For such high risk entities, the KYC approach should involve customer risk profiling and assignment of specific risk rates, and the resort to Enhanced Customer Due Diligence techniques (ECDD). The ECDD techniques should include but not limited to:</p>
          <p>

As such, socially and financially disadvantaged applicants resident in Ghana should not be precluded from opening accounts or obtaining other financial services merely because they do not possess evidence to identify themselves.
            Where a financial institution has reasonable grounds to conclude that an individual client is not able to produce the detailed evidence of his identity and cannot reasonably be expected to do so, the institution may accept as identification evidence, a letter or statement from a person in a position of responsibility who knows the client and can confirm that the client is who he/she says he/she is, including confirmation of his permanent address. The ID of the guarantor shall be obtained and verified.

            <span className={styles.label}>5.8</span>Source of Wealth and Source of Funds
          </h3>
          <p>Source of Wealth refers to the total wealth or the majority of the wealth of a customer, the activities which have generated or contributed to a customer’s accumulation of funds and assets. Source of wealth therefore describes how a customer acquired their total wealth over time i.e. the source(s) through which the wealth was generated. All legitimate assets that can be confirmed are valued and included within the individual’s net worth summary.
              Source of Funds nonetheless refers to the origin of the particular funds or assets which are the subject of the business relationship between Built and its client. The transactions Built is required to undertake on behalf of the client - the amounts being deposited or remitted.

            <span className={styles.label}>6.1</span>Definition of Identity
          </h3>
          <p>Identity is defined as a set of attributes, including names used, date of birth, physical features, and the residential address at which a customer may be located, all of which can uniquely identify a natural or legal person. For a natural person, the date of birth should be obtained as an important identifier in support of the name. However, it is not mandatory to verify the date of birth provided by the customer.</p>
          <h3>
            {" "}
            <span className={styles.label}>6.2</span>Timing of Verification of Identity
          </h3>
          <p>Identity must be verified whenever a business relationship is to be established, or a one-off transaction or series of linked transactions is undertaken. For the purpose of this manual, the definition of transactions includes the giving of advice. However, advice does not include the provision of information about the availability of products of services or to a first interview/discussion prior to establishing a relationship. Once identification procedures have been satisfactorily completed, and the business relationship established, as long as contract or activity is maintained and records concerning that customer are kept, no further evidence of identity is needed when any transaction or activity is subsequently undertaken.</p>

          <p>These are persons who are or have occupied high public office (See AppendixIV for a comprehensive list of PEPs). There is, thus, a possibility that such persons may abuse their public powers for unjust and illicit personal gain through the receipt of bribes, frauds, etc. Business relationship with such PEPs or entities associated with them may expose Built to significant reputational and/or legal risks. Accepting and managing funds from corrupt PEPs will seriously damage Built’s reputation and could erode confidence in the financial system. Furthermore, the legal repercussions could be costly since, in certain circumstances, Built and/or its officers and staff may be liable to criminal sanctions against money laundering if they know, or should have known, that the  funds in question derived from corruption or other predicate offences. Thus, all the relevant AML laws and regulations, including suspicious transaction reporting, tipping off, etc., apply.Heavy fines have been imposed on financial institutions for conducting business with PEPs without adequate KYC and enhanced due diligence procedures. Even in the absence of an explicit legal requirement, it is undesirable and unprofessional for a financial institution to accept or maintain a business relationship if the institution knows or must assume that the funds derive from corruption or misuse of public assets. In the circumstances, it is imperative on Officers representing Built when entering into a relationship with a person who is suspected of being a PEP to identify that personality fully as well as persons and entities that are clearly related to the PEP.</p>

          </h3>  
          <p>Trusts, nominee companies and fiduciaries conduct a wide variety of commercial activities and often play important and legitimate roles in the global economy. However, the unique features of trusts which attract genuine operators and the anonymity and complexity of structures which they often provide, all tend to make them attractive for criminal activity. Accordingly, there have been general concerns about the misuse of corporate vehicles by criminals to disguise and convert the proceeds of their illegal activities and the use of trusts and other quasi-corporate entities to facilitate such misuse. Given that trusts and other quasi-corporate entities take different forms and are pervasive, the money laundering risk should be identified and managed on a service-by-service basis. Thus, customer identification procedures should be established to reflect the perceived Identity of the trustee(s), the settler(s), i.e. the provider of the funds, the controllers (who have the power to remove the trustees) beneficiaries, and signatories should be verified . The underlying evidence of identity should be kept together with the account- opening records.</p>

          <p>There is particular concern over the ease with which corporate entities could be created and dissolved in some jurisdictions which facilitates the use of these vehicles not only for legitimate purposes but also for criminal activities, such as money laundering. Given the potential risk of misuse of corporate vehicles and the AML protection afforded by factors such as the quality of available information, knowledge of the ultimate beneficial owners as well as the assets and their business objectives, Built officials should obtain beneficial ownership information and perform customer due diligence at the commencement, and during the course, of a business relationship. This is particularly the case at the wallet-opening stage. Furthermore, Built Management should painstakingly verify the legal existence of the company from official documents or sources and that those persons claiming to act on behalf of the company are duly authorized.</p>

          </h3>
          <p>For private companies and other legal entities undertaking higher risk business, Built Management should, in addition to the usual requirements for companies, seek to lift the corporate veil and identify those who have ultimate control over the business and the company’s assets. Identification evidence is required for those shareholders who have significant shareholding (as defined by competent authority) and those who are mandated to manage funds, accounts or investments without further authorization and are thus in a position to override internal procedures and control measures. In keeping with a risk-based approach, identification evidence should be obtained not only for the principal beneficial owners and those who exercise control over the assets of the company but also the non-executive directors. Built Management should undertake a visit  to the place of business if the volume is large enough not only to confirm the existence of the business and the nature and purpose but also its legitimacy. An international business company which is registered in an offshore jurisdiction but operates out of a different jurisdiction requires particular attention. Accordingly, such companies should be subjected to rigorous customer due diligence procedures.</p>
