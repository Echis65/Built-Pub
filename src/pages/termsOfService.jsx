            disputes relating to or arising from these Terms (including the
            arbitrability thereof), shall be settled by binding confidential
            arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Alternative
            Dispute Resolution Act 2010 and the International Chamber of
            Commerce (“ICC”) Rules of Arbitration or any successor provision
            thereto, as follows: Any party aggrieved will deliver a notice to
            the other party setting forth the specific points in dispute. Any
            points remaining in dispute fourteen (14) days after the giving of
            such notice may be submitted to ICC arbitration conducted before a
            single neutral arbitrator in Accra, Ghana. The arbitrator shall be
            appointed by agreement of the parties hereto or, if no agreement can
            be reached, by ICC. The arbitrator may enter a default decision
            against any party who fails to participate in the arbitration
            proceedings. The decision of the arbitrator on the points in dispute
            will be final, unappealable and binding, and judgment on the award
            may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The parties
            agree that this provision has been adopted to rapidly and

            post-arbitration actions seeking to enforce an arbitration award or
            proceedings seeking equitable relief as permitted by this div
            8.2. Each party will bear its own expenses and the fees of its own
            attorneys. The parties and the arbitrator will keep confidential,
            and will not disclose to any person, except the parties’ advisors
            and legal representatives, or as may be required by law or to
            enforce in court an arbitrator’s award, the existence of any dispute
            hereunder.
